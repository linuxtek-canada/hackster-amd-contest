March 22, 2024:
* Announced I had been selected as one of the winners for the Generative AI - Cloud category in the AMD Pervasive AI Contest.
* I had requested a local GPU, as my project was based on local LLM usage, and there was confusion around the selection.
* Had discussed in Discord, and on [the forums](https://www.hackster.io/contests/amd2023/discussion/posts/11363#challengeNav). Submitted petition for review.

April 12, 2024:
* Followed up on petition as I had not heard back.
