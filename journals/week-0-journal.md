## Summary

November 30, 2023:
* Studied for and completed AI hardware quiz (Score: 86).
* Submitted [proposal for project](https://www.hackster.io/contests/amd2023/hardware_applications/16336) and requested hardware.
* Time Spent: 2 hours.

March 22, 2024:
* Announced I had been selected as one of the winners for the Generative AI - Cloud category in the AMD Pervasive AI Contest.
* I had requested a local GPU, as my project was based on local LLM usage, and there was confusion around the selection.
* Had discussed in Discord, and on [the forums](https://www.hackster.io/contests/amd2023/discussion/posts/11363#challengeNav). Submitted petition for review.

April 12, 2024:
* Followed up on petition as I had not heard back. 
* Some confusion with the result, as I had been marked as "okay with MI210", even though the petition was specifically about reviewing for physical GPU.
* Added to waitlist for hardware.
